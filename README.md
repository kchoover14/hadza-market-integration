## Hadza Childhood Health and Remote Market Integration

Linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) -- permanent dental defects formed during early childhood -- were assessed in 81 bush-living Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania to examine long-term trends in developmental stress across a 62-year birth cohort. A linear mixed-effects model and Bayesian confirmation (brms) identified a significant interaction between birth year and sex: male hypoplasia rates declined 71% after 1975 while female rates remained flat. The 1975 turning point coincides with the onset of remote market integration -- researchers and tourists bringing goods and currency to bush camps -- and a bibliometric analysis of published Hadza research reveals decades of external bias toward men's activities that may have driven the disparity.

## Repository Contents

This repo contains two sets of files. All files prefixed `revised-` are revised scripts and figures from the original publication. Revisions offer a fully reproducible end-to-end pipeline from raw data through ETL to results — including, **when needed**, data cleaning and wrangling scripts (revised from originals or created where none existed), code modernization, and the addition of environment management to future-proof the revised scripts. All other files are associated with the original publication. Occasionally, an original script may be updated with annotations for clarity; the commit history will note any such changes.
